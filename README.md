# Practical 4: Vector Drawing


### Implemeted Requirements:

[BASIC]
- Drawing straight lines.
- Drawing rectangles.
- Drawing ellipses.
- Drawing diagonal crosses.
- Undo/redo.
- Different colours.
- Create JUNIT TEST for Model functionalities.

[ADVANCED]
- Support for drawing squares and circles. One way of implementing this feature would be
  using a key (say the Shift key) to lock aspect ratio during the drawing of rectangles and
  ellipses. 
- Load and save vector drawings in a format that permits them to be manipulated as vector
  drawings after loading.
- Add Murray polygons.
